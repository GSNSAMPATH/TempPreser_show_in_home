It looks like you meant BMP180 with Arduino. The BMP180 is a barometric pressure sensor that can measure altitude, pressure, and temperature. It's commonly used in weather monitoring, altimeters, and navigation systems.

ðŸ“Œ Wiring BMP180 with Arduino
The BMP180 communicates using I2C. Here's how to connect it:

------------------------------------------
|BMP180 Pin |	Arduino Pin              |
------------------------------------------
| VCC	    | 3.3V                       |
| GND	    | GND                        |
| SDA	    | A4 (on Uno) / 21 (on Mega) |
| SCL	    | A5 (on Uno) / 20 (on Mega) |
